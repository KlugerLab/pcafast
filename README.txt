src/pcafast.m:  Given A, calculates nearly optimal rank-k approximation USV', with and without centering, for general sparse and dense matrices.  This is where most users will start.
src/diffsnorm.m: Calculates the 2-norm accuracy of an approximation to a matrix.  Generally used to calculate accuracy of matrices generated by pcafast.m
src/eigen.m: Eigendecomposition of a self-adjoint (and possibly non-negative definite) matrix
src/diffsnormschur.m: Calculates 2-norm accuracy of Schur decomp. of a matrix.  Generally used to calculate accuracy of matrices generated by eigen.m
src/adaptivepca.m: Adaptive randomized range finder (Algorithm randQB_pb of Martinsson and Voronin (2015).  It calculates an approximation USV' that is within a given tolerance of A
src/examples.m: Provides some example usages
